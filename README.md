# color_aimbot
This tutorial introduces an aimbot script designed for a first-person shooter game, specifically tailored for use in games like Valorant. The script utilizes color detection to identify enemy structures, represented by purple hue outlines.

The aimbot calculates target positions, adjusts field of view (FOV), and implements mouse actions accordingly. Threading is utilized to handle keyboard input for script termination while maintaining continuous execution. Additionally, limitations and potential inaccuracies due to color detection are discussed, highlighting the script's potential for detection by game anti-cheat systems. 

The tutorial concludes with a demonstration and a mention of future videos exploring triggerbot implementation. The script's code is made available on GitHub for experimentation.
